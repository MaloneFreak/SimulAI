# SimulAI ü§ñ

## About the Project
SimulAI is an innovative web tool that transforms AI-generated text into interactive mock tests. Conceived by Pedro, it addresses a common challenge for students: the difficulty of quickly and efficiently creating and grading study exams.

With SimulAI, you can request any AI (GPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) to create questions on a specific topic, and with a simple "copy and paste," the tool generates a mock test that can be answered and evaluated instantly, providing feedback and explanations for each answer.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Intelligent Text Analysis**: Copy and paste text directly from the AI. SimulAI handles the rest.
- **Interactive Mock Test Generation**: Questions are transformed into a clean, user-friendly multiple-choice form.
- **Instant Evaluation**: Click the "AvaliaAI" button to grade your answers.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Incorrect answers are highlighted in red with the correct explanation displayed automatically. For correct answers, explanations can be viewed optionally.
- **Mock Test History**: All your results are saved in a private history, allowing you to track progress and retake tests to reinforce learning.

## üöÄ How to Use
Using SimulAI is incredibly simple, thanks to the "Magic Prompt" concept.

### Step 1: Generate Questions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your preferred AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.), replacing [YOUR TOPIC HERE] with the subject you want to study.

```
Create X questions about [YOUR TOPIC HERE]. For EACH question (even if it‚Äôs a sub-question like "Question 1," "Question 2"), follow this EXACT format:

Start with the question text (may include a preamble).

List the options (A, B, C, D).

Mark the correct answer with the ‚úÖ emoji before the letter (e.g., ‚úÖ C) ...).

Provide an explanation starting with "üí° Explanation:".

Do NOT add question numbers (e.g., 1., 2., etc.) at the start; just write the question.

IMPORTANT: Separate EACH question with "---" on its own line.
```

### Step 2: Paste into SimulAI
Copy the entire response generated by the AI and paste it into SimulAI‚Äôs text area.

### Step 3: Simulate and Evaluate
Click "Analyze and Simulate Test," answer the questions, and at the end, click "AvaliaAI ‚ú®" to see your performance and learn from the corrections.

### Step 4: Track Your Progress
Access the "History" tab to view all the mock tests you‚Äôve taken, your scores, and the option to retake them.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Setup (For Developers)
To run SimulAI locally or fork the project, you‚Äôll need to set up a Firebase project for the history functionality.

### Create a Firebase Project
1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Click "Add project" and follow the instructions.

### Create a Web App
1. In your project‚Äôs dashboard, click the web icon (</>) to add a new web app.
2. Name your app and click "Register app."
3. Firebase will provide a `firebaseConfig` object. You don‚Äôt need to save it, as the code is already set up to handle it.

### Set Up Firestore Database
1. In the sidebar, go to "Cloud Firestore."
2. Click "Create database" and start in production mode.
3. Choose your database location (e.g., `southamerica-east1` for Brazil).

### Add Security Rules
1. In Firestore, go to the "Rules" tab.
2. Copy and paste the contents of the `firestore rules.txt` file from this repository. These rules ensure each user can only view and write to their own history.
3. Click "Publish."

### Configure Firebase in Your HTML

1. Replace this line in your code:

```
// Original fallback line:
const firebaseConfig = typeof __firebase_config !== 'undefined' ? JSON.parse(__firebase_config) : { apiKey: "DEMO", authDomain: "DEMO", projectId: "DEMO" };
```

With your actual Firebase configuration (copied from your Firebase Console):

```
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key-here",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

### Get Your Firebase Configuration

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Open your project
3. Click the ‚öôÔ∏è gear icon ‚Üí **Project Settings**
4. Scroll down to the **Your Apps** section
5. Click the web icon `</>`
6. Copy the `firebaseConfig` object displayed in the **SDK setup and config** section.

### Enable Anonymous Sign-in in Firebase

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. In the left menu, click **Authentication**
4. Go to the **Sign-in method** tab
5. Find the **Anonymous** provider and click the pencil icon ‚úèÔ∏è
6. Enable the toggle and click **Save**

### Run the `SimulAI.html` File
To enable the history feature, serve `SimulAI.html` via a local server (e.g., using the "Live Server" extension in VS Code) or host it on platforms like GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify. Opening the file directly in a browser may not work due to JavaScript module security policies.
1. Open VS Code
2. Install the "Live Server" extension
3. Open your SimulAI.html file in VS Code
4. Right-click on the file
5. Select "Open with Live Server"
Done! It will automatically open in your browser

Or via terminal:
1. Inside the folder where SimulAI.html is located:
`python -m http.server 8000`
2. Then go to: `http://localhost:8000/SimulAI.html`

## üíª Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3 with Tailwind CSS** for fast and responsive styling
- **JavaScript (ES6 Modules)** for the application‚Äôs logic
- **Firebase (Firestore)** for secure and private mock test history storage
