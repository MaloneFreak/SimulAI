SimulAI ü§ñ
About the Project
SimulAI is an innovative web tool that transforms AI-generated text into interactive mock tests. Conceived by Pedro, it addresses a common challenge for students: the difficulty of quickly and efficiently creating and grading study exams.
With SimulAI, you can request any AI (GPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) to create questions on a specific topic, and with a simple "copy and paste," the tool generates a mock test that can be answered and evaluated instantly, providing feedback and explanations for each answer.

‚ú® Features

Intelligent Text Analysis: Copy and paste text directly from the AI. SimulAI handles the rest.
Interactive Mock Test Generation: Questions are transformed into a clean, user-friendly multiple-choice form.
Instant Evaluation: Click the "AvaliaAI" button to grade your answers.
Constructive Feedback: Incorrect answers are highlighted in red with the correct explanation displayed automatically. For correct answers, explanations can be viewed optionally.
Mock Test History: All your results are saved in a private history, allowing you to track progress and retake tests to reinforce learning.

üöÄ How to Use
Using SimulAI is incredibly simple, thanks to the "Magic Prompt" concept.
Step 1: Generate Questions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your preferred AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.), replacing [YOUR TOPIC HERE] with the subject you want to study.
Create X questions about [YOUR TOPIC HERE]. For EACH question (even if it‚Äôs a sub-question like "Question 1," "Question 2"), follow this EXACT format:

Start with the question text (may include a preamble).

List the options (A, B, C, D).

Mark the correct answer with the ‚úÖ emoji before the letter (e.g., ‚úÖ C) ...).

Provide an explanation starting with "üí° Explanation:".

Do NOT add question numbers (e.g., 1., 2., etc.) at the start; just write the question.

IMPORTANT: Separate EACH question with "---" on its own line.

Step 2: Paste into SimulAI
Copy the entire response generated by the AI and paste it into SimulAI‚Äôs text area.
Step 3: Simulate and Evaluate
Click "Analyze and Simulate Test," answer the questions, and at the end, click "AvaliaAI ‚ú®" to see your performance and learn from the corrections.
Step 4: Track Your Progress
Access the "History" tab to view all the mock tests you‚Äôve taken, your scores, and the option to retake them.
üõ†Ô∏è Local Setup (For Developers)
To run SimulAI locally or fork the project, you‚Äôll need to set up a Firebase project for the history functionality.
Create a Firebase Project

Go to the Firebase Console.
Click "Add project" and follow the instructions.

Create a Web App

In your project‚Äôs dashboard, click the web icon (</>) to add a new web app.
Name your app and click "Register app."
Firebase will provide a firebaseConfig object. You don‚Äôt need to save it, as the code is already set up to handle it.

Set Up Firestore Database

In the sidebar, go to "Cloud Firestore."
Click "Create database" and start in production mode.
Choose your database location (e.g., southamerica-east1 for Brazil).

Add Security Rules

In Firestore, go to the "Rules" tab.
Copy and paste the contents of the firestore.rules file from this repository. These rules ensure each user can only view and write to their own history.
Click "Publish."

Run the index.html File
To enable the history feature, serve index.html via a local server (e.g., using the "Live Server" extension in VS Code) or host it on platforms like GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify. Opening the file directly in a browser may not work due to JavaScript module security policies.
üíª Technologies Used

HTML5
CSS3 with Tailwind CSS for fast and responsive styling
JavaScript (ES6 Modules) for the application‚Äôs logic
Firebase (Firestore) for secure and private mock test history storage
