# SimulAI 🤖

## About the Project
SimulAI is an innovative, **offline-first** web tool that transforms AI-generated text into interactive mock tests. Conceived by MaloneFreak, it addresses a common challenge for students: the difficulty of quickly and efficiently creating and grading study exams.

With SimulAI v1.2, you can request any AI (GPT, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek) to create questions on a specific topic, and with a simple "copy and paste," the tool generates a mock test that can be answered and evaluated instantly.

**New in v1.2:** The tool now runs entirely in your browser using LocalStorage (no database setup required) and supports Math/LaTeX rendering for exact sciences!

*(Note: Interface may vary slightly in the latest version)*

## ✨ Features
- **🔒 Privacy First & Offline**: No servers, no login. All data is processed locally and saved to your browser's LocalStorage.
- **🧮 Math & LaTeX Support**: Perfect for Engineering and Calculus students. Renders equations like $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}$ beautifully.
- **⚡ Intelligent Parsing Engine 10.0**: Improved text analysis that isolates context, preventing formatting errors in complex questions.
- **📊 History & Analytics**: Track your progress with a persistent history tab and export your data to JSON for backup.
- **Instant Feedback**: Real-time grading with constructive explanations for every answer.

## 🚀 How to Use
Using SimulAI is incredibly simple.

### Step 1: Generate Questions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your preferred AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.), replacing `[TOPIC]` with your subject.

```text
Create 5 questions about [TOPIC].
Format for EACH question:

Question 1: [Statement]
A) [Text]
B) [Text]
C) [Text]
D) [Text]
✅ [Correct Letter]
💡 Explanation: [Explanation]
---
````

### Step 2: Paste into SimulAI

Copy the entire response generated by the AI and paste it into SimulAI’s input area. Click **"GERAR SIMULADO"**.

### Step 3: Simulate and Evaluate

Answer the questions and click **"Corrigir"**. You will see your score and detailed feedback.

### Step 4: Track Your Progress

Navigate to the **"History"** tab to review past attempts or retry a quiz.

## 🛠️ Local Setup (Zero Configuration)

Unlike previous versions, **SimulAI v1.2 requires no backend configuration**.

1.  **Download** the `SimulAI.html` file from this repository.
2.  **Open** the file directly in your browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
3.  **Done\!** The app is ready to use.

*Optional for Developers:*
If you want to make changes to the code, you can run it using a local server to ensure all assets load correctly, though it works fine via double-click due to the removal of strict module dependencies.

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
# Go to http://localhost:8000/SimulAI.html
```

## 💻 Technologies Used

  - **HTML5 & CSS3** (with Tailwind CSS via CDN)
  - **Vanilla JavaScript** (No frameworks, high performance)
  - **MathJax** (For rendering mathematical LaTeX notation)
  - **LocalStorage API** (For persisting data without a database)
